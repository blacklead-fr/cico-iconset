## Using Cico
You can use Cico for commercial themes, plugins, websites and projects.

#### Using Cico with HTML/ CSS

1. Download Cico and add the **webfonts** directory to your site.
2. Place the code below within the `<head>` of each template or page that you want to use Cico on.
```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="webfonts/css/css.min.css" />
```
3. Add icons in your HTML's `<body>`. To add an icon, create a new element `<span>` and insert the two classes "cico" and "cico-SOMETHING". Replace "SOMETHING" by the icon's name of your choice. Example:
```
  <span class="cico cico-comet"></span>
```
